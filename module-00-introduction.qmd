Welcome to the OS220 Course Description. This slide highlights what learners will gain from this
course.

[pause 0.5s]

The OpenStack Administration and Operations course is designed to provide you with a complete
experience administering and operating the most common OpenStack components. These components
allow you to implement Infrastructure as a Service, commonly called I-A-A-S, in a private cloud.

[pause 0.5s]

You will learn everything from image management to instance creation, to network plugins and
more. This is a comprehensive course covering the full lifecycle of OpenStack operations.

::: {.notes}

[pause 1.0s]

Here are the high-level objectives for the OS220 course.

[pause 0.5s]

The OpenStack Administration and Operations course will teach you how to use the command line
interface, also called C-L-I, and the user interface to gain hands-on experience with operating
and managing OpenStack.

[pause 0.5s]

You will learn a variety of administrative tasks, including managing users, projects, roles,
permissions, and quotas. You will also work with images, block storage, and volume services.

[pause 0.5s]

You will launch and configure instances, and learn how security groups and S-S-H keys protect
your cloud resources.

[pause 0.5s]

You will use the orchestration service to deploy complex stacks, including integration with
telemetry services for autoscaling. As an optional exercise, you may create a Heat template.

[pause 0.5s]

We use reference implementations throughout, keeping the content vendor agnostic.

## OS220 Target Audience

- System and Network Administrators
- Technical IT Professionals
- Deployment Engineers
- Cloud Administrators
- Cloud Operations Personnel

::: {.notes}

[pause 1.0s]

The typical course attendee is someone looking to gain a deeper understanding of OpenStack and
its cloud ecosystem. This goes into more detail than what is offered in the OS100 course.

[pause 0.5s]

This can include a variety of people from different parts of the business. These roles may
include system and network administrators, technical I-T professionals, deployment engineers,
cloud administrators, and cloud operations personnel as they begin their technical journey using
and working with OpenStack.

:::

---

## Prerequisites: Knowledge

- Basic Linux command line experience
- OS100 or equivalent experience
- Understanding of hypervisors
- Networking and storage helpful

::: {.notes}

[pause 1.0s]

Learners in this course are expected to come in with some baseline experience with the Linux
command line and foundational knowledge of systems and network administration.

[pause 0.5s]

You should also have taken our OS100 OpenStack Essentials course, or have equivalent OpenStack
experience. This includes use of OpenStack command line and user interfaces, as well as an
understanding of hypervisors and virtualization.

[pause 0.5s]

An understanding of networking and storage virtualization is helpful as you undertake this
course.

:::

---

## Prerequisites: Lab Requirements

- Web browser (Chrome or Firefox)
- Account on Strigo.io
- Disconnect from company VPN
- SSH client (optional)

::: {.notes}

[pause 1.0s]

For the lab exercises, you will need a computer with an internet connection and access to a
web browser such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.

[pause 0.5s]

A Strigo.io lab environment is provided for the lab exercises. Please make sure you have an
account set up before the course begins.

[pause 0.5s]

Also, please ensure you are disconnected from your company V-P-N during lab exercises. An
S-S-H client will allow for additional options when attempting lab exercises, but that is
optional.

:::

## Course Structure

- Four-day hands-on class
- Complete administration experience
- Real-world operational scenarios
- Aligned with COA exam objectives

::: {.notes}

[pause 1.0s]

This course is structured as a four-day hands-on class that provides complete component
administration experience.

[pause 0.5s]

Throughout the course, you will work through real-world operational scenarios that mirror what
you will encounter in production environments.

[pause 0.5s]

At the end of this course, with dedicated study and practice, you will have the skills required
to pass the Certified OpenStack Administrator exam, also known as the C-O-A exam. The learning
topics are specifically aligned with C-O-A exam objectives to help prepare you for certification.

:::

---

## Course Delivery Format

- 50% instructor-led presentations
- 50% hands-on lab exercises
- Labs follow each lecture section
- Real-world practice scenarios

::: {.notes}

[pause 1.0s]

This course is structured in two parts. Fifty percent of the course will be instructor-led
presentations, and the other fifty percent of the time will be spent on hands-on lab exercises.

[pause 0.5s]

After each section, there will be a lab exercise to give learners hands-on experience with the
technologies discussed in the lectures.

## Vendor Agnostic Approach

- No proprietary add-ons used
- LVM for Block Storage
- Open vSwitch for L2 networking
- KVM and QEMU for hypervisor

::: {.notes}

[pause 1.0s]

All Mirantis OpenStack courses are vendor agnostic. This is an important distinction.

[pause 0.5s]

Tasks are performed in an OpenStack environment without any vendor add-ons that might change
the way OpenStack works. We use reference implementations throughout the course. Reference
implementations are the default or standard implementations that come with OpenStack.

[pause 0.5s]

Specifically, we use Logical Volume Manager, or L-V-M, for Block Storage. We use Open vSwitch,
also called O-V-S, for Layer 2 networking. And we use K-V-M and Q-E-M-U for the hypervisor.

[pause 0.5s]

This approach ensures that the skills you learn apply to any OpenStack distribution, not just a
specific vendor implementation. Whether your organization uses Red Hat OpenStack, Canonical
Charmed OpenStack, or Mirantis OpenStack, the skills you learn here will transfer directly.
